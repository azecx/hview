Hview, short for html-view, is a barebones "browser" and HTML parser to render the simplest of web pages.

Example of what hview can fetch & render as of [`60d6d77`](https://github.com/azecx/hview/commit/60d6d77aebc68473387653bfce6993662d4c528b):

## Disclaimer

Hview is still very much a work in progress, with plenty left to do. My goal of this project is to deepen my knowledge of C++ and SDL2 - **not** necessarily to build a fully functional browser.
