Hview, short for html-view, is a barebones "browser" and HTML parser to render the simplest of web pages.

It's still very much work in progress, with a lot of stuff left to do. I'm working on it to improve my knowledge of C++ and SDL2 further **not** to have it work as an actual browser.

If you for some reason want to contribute to this mess, feel free to!
